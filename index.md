# Our Mission
Our mission with Spriggan is simple, to give creators complete artistic freedom by making censorship impossible. Spriggan is created by creators, for creators. It is completely decentralized and open-source, allowing creators to publish and sell their work directly to their audience without any middlemen or payment processors.

Our first target is the PC gaming market, and the multi-billion dollar goliath that is Steam, owned by Valve.

# What is Spriggan

Spriggan started as an idea to create a video game marketplace that was completely decentralized and permissionless using Peer-to-Peer technologies like Bittorrent and blockchain, but the idea has expanded since then. Spriggan is an attempt to break apart the vertical monopoly that is inherent to centralized digital publishing of not only games but all forms of digital media.

## What Censorship are Creators Facing?

There are 2 types of censorship, and 2 types of censors. Let's call them hard, and soft censorship. And let's call the censors institutional, and social censors.

Hard censorship is the banning, or removal of a creator, or their content. Soft censorship is placing restrictions on creators in the form of "terms of service" and other content guidelines. This causes artists to self censor before before creating their work in the first place.

Institutional censors are conventional platforms, advertisers, payment processors, banks, governments, etc. Social censors are activist organizations, twitter mobs, etc that don't have direct control to hard censor, but by raising enough fuss, can force institutional censors to act.

You may think I am being a conspiracy theorist when I'm talking about governments and banks censoring content, but I'm not. Hard censorship is much more common than you probably think it is. There are [hundreds of instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banned_video_games_by_country) of govenments all around the world banning certain video games for all kinds of reasons. Often, it isn't the most extreme content that gets banned, it is only notable products that reach a large enough scale of outrage for governments to act. It is not unreasonable for artists to fear more general, wide spread censorship policies that make their work illegal in many countries including western countries that are relatively liberal. The most common cause of government bans (aside from the obvious violence and sexual content) are depicting gambling or drug use, LGBT themes, and political messaging. There isn't much that can be done about the laws of other countries, but through decentralization we can make it much harder for governments to ban content on a practical level. This is especially important when talking about content with political themes, and issues regarding human rights. Artistic freedom for this type of content is extremely important.

It is very common for payment processors and banks to pressure platforms to ban any type of sexualized content. Mastercard and Visa are the biggest players in this, they have a history of [going against pornographic content](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/20/tech/onlyfans-explicit-content-ban-payment/index.html). But Paypal also has dipped it's toes into to censorship game by [seizing the funds](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lewd-idol-project-paypal-account-locked-kickstarter-funds) of several Patreon and Kickstarter projects with sexual themes.

Whether through pressure from payment processors, or of their own free will, many platforms large and small participate in censorship. Apple has made its [stance on sexualized content very clear](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5), it is almost impossible to release content with a hint of sexuality on any apple device. Last year gaming platform GameJolt [banned all games with sexual content](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/01/game-jolt-bans-sex/). Recently there have been rumours that itch.io, one of the largest platforms for indie game developers [may cut off some of the payment options for games with sexual content](https://itch.io/t/2809361/will-adult-games-be-forced-into-direct-payments-instead-of-collected-by-itchio). Steam, by far the largest PC gaming platform allows sexual content, and is fairly opposed to censorship, but cases still fall through the cracks. I myself was hard censored by Steam. I released a game that I thought followed their terms of service, but according to the person who reviewed my game, it did not. It wasn't sexual content that got my game banned, it was a perfectly normal PG-13 scene where 2 teenage characters kissed. This was deemed "sexual content involving a minor" and resulted in my game being completely removed from the platform.

As bad as hard censorship is, soft censorship is actually more harmful to artistic freedom. Every creator regardless of their medium and platform is constantly fighting against the terms of service and has to walk on eggshells to avoid having their sources of revenue cut off. If you look for it, you will see self censorship everywhere. Even on meaningless social media posts with no money at stake people still censor themselves when talking about topics like mental health, gender and sexuality, and political issues in fear of being censored by algorithms. These topics are incredibly important for people to talk about, and that censorship is extremely harmful.

Social censors have become a big deal in the past 5-10 years with the rise of social media. Being "canceled" is a big deal. Social censors absolutly have the ability to force institutional censors to act. There are many instances like the youtube "ad-pocalypse" where social censors forced advertisers to pull their funding, and on smaller scales having sponsers drop creators. Ironically, it can be both good or bad to get canceled by a twitter mob. The attention that it brings can be very benifitial to creators, but can also be dangerous. Many artists, myself included like to hide our identity. When you create potentially controvercial artwork it is almost guaranteed that you will be harassed by some group of people online. With doxxing, there is solid chance of that harassment can carry over into the real world. The more that we can protect artists right to control their own privacy, the better.

## Why does Spriggan use a Blockchain?

There is a very large stigma attached to blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs in the games industry that is shared by not only the audience, but by creators as well. We understand that stigma. It is important to note that Spriggan is fundamentally different than other crypto projects. I would even argue that we aren't even a cryptocurrency project. There is no token to buy, no investments, it is just open source software that allows its users to interact with an existing blockchain.

Creators need a method of getting paid for their work. The choices are simple, there are 4 options.

* Direct payment via payment processors - Payment directly from consumer to creator through services like stripe or paypal. This is the logical option for direct fiat currency payments. Stripe charges a fee of 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction (paypal: 3.49% + 49¢). Additional fees may be added for international payments, or other factors. The list of people who could censor you are stripe/paypal, visa/mastercard, banks, and governments. It also may require you set up a legal business and/or dox yourself to most if not all of those entities to receive payments.

* Collected by Organization - This is how most platforms like Steam and Epic Games Store work. The platform sells your content for you, handles their own payments, and pays you out monthly via a payment processor, or direct bank transfer. The organization then has complete control over your sales, and often charge a large fee (15-30%) for the privilege of reaching their audience. The list of possible censors is the platform, all payment processors supported by the platform, banks, and governments. It also may require you set up a legal business and/or dox yourself to most if not all of those entities to receive payments. This only makes sense for those platforms because they have a large established userbase that they can leverage against creators. Given that this is the model that Spriggan is trying to destroy, it is obviously not an option for us.

* Cash - Cash is great, it's very censorship resistant, but obviously not an option for the digital world.

* Cryptocurrencies - Proper usage of public blockchain allows for uncensorable and unstoppable payments. There are a lot of downsides to using crypto currencies. The biggest one being that very few people already use crypto currencies at all, much less for real transactions. Fees are another issue. They are a big unknown on the long term. The technology is still evolving, there are theoretically ways to scale to support huge numbers of transactions, very cheaply, but it's not sure when that technology will be practical. Fees are virtually 0 now, but there could be potentially be times where fees get out of control.

The choice to use a blockchain is a clear one. There is no way to create a truly free and open market without using a blockchain. It is not the easy path, but it is the right path.

## Which Blockchain does Spriggan use?

The question of which blockchain to use is not simple, there are a lot of options. Some have come up with revolutionary tech, some are pale immitations of others, and some are complete garbage scams. It was a lot of work to sort through all of them and figure which are legitimate, legally compliant, have the right features, and are built by the most competent people. It may seem random that we have chosen to build Spriggan on [Chia](https://www.chia.net/), a relatively new and unknown blockchain, but it is anything but random. Here are just some of the reasons why Chia was selected.

### True Peer to Peer Trading

Chia has a technology called offer files, which is something that does not exist on any other blockchain. Other blockchains claim to have “Decentralized Exchange”, but it’s all fake, backed by liquidity pools and smart contracts that are prone to hacks and scams. It’s hard to understand how revolutionary offer files are without experiencing them directly. Chia has true p2p trading that does not require an exchange, or any 3rd party. This is an offer file 👇

You could copy and paste this into a Chia wallet to buy an NFT directly from my wallet to yours. I don’t have to know or care who you are and it’s completely secure. The only thing you can do with this offer is ignore it, or accept it and trade 1 XCH for my 1 shitty, worthless NFT.

That is how trading works under the hood on Chia, and how it cannot be censored. A common saying in Chia is that exchange is a verb, and not a noun. Using offer files, any means of communication, including this blog can be used to trade any arbitrary assets globally and completely trustlessly.

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance
Fraud is rampant in the cryptocurrency world. Chia was founded in 2017, and didn’t launch publicly until 2021. Chia could have launched a lot sooner, and made a lot more money if they didn’t do things the right way. Chia has worked with the SEC since the beginning and has not participated in the questionable, and illegal activity that other blockchain companies have been involved in. Chia has gone through the conventional process of raising funding and is preparing for an IPO when they will become the first blockchain company to go public.

Chia is the only blockchain company working directly with multiple governments through their partnership with the World Bank. This would not be possible without their legal compliance, which makes them the clear choice for building real blockchain applications that go beyond the crypto casino.

### Energy usage
Bitcoin, and any other blockchain that uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus consumes way too much energy. That is obviously horrible for the environment. Chia’s Proof-of-Space-and-Time (PoST) consumes less than 0.1% of the energy as bitcoin, for equal or better security.
![Chia Energy Usage](/assets/images/chiaEnergy.jpg)

### Not Proof-of-Stake
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is often touted as a solution to bitcoins energy usage, but PoS has huge security flaws that make PoS blockchains very centralized. The most important number when measuring a blockchains security is the Nakamoto Coefficient, which in simple terms, is the number of the largest entities that would have to collude to take control of the blockchain. Most blockchains (including bitcoin, and other top blockchains by market cap) have an estimated NC of < 10, some are as low as 2-3. Chia's NC is by far the highest at ~90 as of writing. Chia is by far the most decentralized blockchain in existance with over 100,000 nodes [all over the world](https://dashboard.chia.net/d/em15uQ47k/peer-info?orgId=1).


### A Good Team Behind it
Chia was founded by Bram Cohen, the inventor of the Bittorrent protocol. Bitcoin was inspired by and named after Bittorrent. Bram invented peer to peer technologies and is one of the most brilliant minds in computing. There is not a person on earth more qualified to design a public blockchain.

## Is Moderation without Censorship Possible?

This is a difficult question that many people have pondered for a long time. To have a successful marketplace for anything, moderation is necessary. Even if you intend to allow everything, even illegal or questionable content, you still have to protect users against spam and outright fraud to provide a good experience.

We designed Spriggan with this problem in mind. What we did was limit moderation power to only what was absolutely necessary to moderate effectively and make everything else completely permissionless. The only part of Spriggan that can be moderated is the back-end of the marketplace, a database that lists games that we have authenticated and have chosen to list on our marketplace. We have no control over payments or content distribution, just our own list of approved products. This allows us to provide a experience free of scams and garbage, while everyone, including scammers can always freely use the core of the system to try to sell their products which are completely compatible with the rest of the system.

We have made it as easy as possible for anyone else to create alternatives to our flagship marketplace, this is actually encouraged. Marketplaces in Spriggan don't profit from sales, and don't censor, they simply verify and authenticate creators. Every product on Spriggan is created equal with all of the same ability to sell and distribute copies, that power can't be taken away. By getting marketplaces to list your product, you gain more legitimacy and visibility. We want to create an environment where there are many of these marketplaces independently verifying and listing projects so that censorship gets more and more impossible. The reputations of their favorite marketplaces gives the customer confidence that they are buying legitimate products from legitimate creators. People and organizations we want to see running these marketplaces are for example, game developers/publishers, youtubers, media outlets, genre specific communities, etc. If you are interested in running your own marketplace on the Spriggan network, please reach out!

In our opinion, this is what moderation without censorship looks like.

## How Spriggan uses private DataLayer tables to authenticate and verify published content

Chia's [DataLayer](https://www.chia.net/datalayer/) is an amazing tool capable of creating public and auditable decentralized databases like the [Climate Action Data Trust](https://climateactiondata.org/). But it can also be used on a much smaller scale to authenticate and verify user data in a decentralized way.

Using our open source tools, creators can create and manage their own private DataLayer data store of products locally on their own system. This data is hashed and put on the blockchain. Using that publicly available hash, anyone can verify that data they have is authentic, while keeping the data private. Creators can be shared their product updates with trusted marketplaces to help distribute updates to everyone who owns a copy of their product. This private data includes torrent files and passwords to decrypt their content, which stay private between the creator, trusted marketplaces, and customers who have purchased the content.

Using this system simplifies publishing greatly because marketplaces do not have to care where their data came from, only that it is legitimate. User authentication is not necessary. When a marketplace receives an update for a product, or a request to list a new product, they only need to check that the hash of the data matches the hash on the blockchain to know that the update is legitimate.
